Project Title: Most Ridiculous Internet Memes
Project Overview:
This website showcases the funniest, most ridiculous memes from around the internet. Users can easily browse through memes, vote on their favorites, and comment on them, all without the need to log in. Memes will be organized by categories like “viral,” “absurd,” and “relatable,” and ranked based on votes from the community.

Rather than submitting their own memes, users interact with a curated selection, creating a hassle-free experience. With features like random meme discovery, a trending section, and search functionality, users will enjoy exploring the best of internet humor.

By focusing on engagement rather than submissions, this project makes it easy for anyone to join in the fun—immediately and without barriers.
